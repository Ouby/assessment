<p>My interest in IT is the learning of new technologies and where technology is going. </p><p>The way that IT is part of everyone life in some way or another I find interesting. With technology constantly growing, being part of that growth can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>It was my first computer, a Sinclair ZX81 that was the start of it for me. Being able to enter a few words on the keyboard, press enter and see a clock face with hands on my TV was exciting. Since then I became more experienced in building systems and installing software. </p><p>I attended TAFE and completed my Diploma of IT and wanting to know more, I feel the option of acquiring a degree is another stage in my life for me.</p>
<p>RMIT allows me to set a goal and to achieve it from home. It allows me to complete courses within my lifestyle that are also flexible. With these studies I expect to learn more of the infrastructure of IT, the ins and outs of technology and a better understanding of the security involved. To learn why things happen and how they happen, I find exciting.
