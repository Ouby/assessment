<h1>Myers-Biggs Test</h1>
<p>We use four letter codes to describe each personality type. To create these codes, we abbreviate each preference with a single letter, for instance E for Extraverted or N for Intuitive. Then we combine the four letters into a personality type like INTJ or ESFP.</p>
<p>The following shows your top 3 personality type matches.</p>
<p>ESTJ - The Supervisor VERY GOOD MATCH</p>
<p>ESTJs are hardworking traditionalists, eager to take charge in organizing projects and people. Orderly, rule-abiding, and conscientious, ESTJs like to get things done, and tend to go about projects in a systematic, methodical way.</p>
<p>ISTJ - The Inspector VERY GOOD MATCH</p>
<p>ISTJs are responsible organizers, driven to create and enforce order within systems and institutions. They are neat and orderly, inside and out, and tend to have a procedure for everything they do.</p>
<p>ENTJ - The Commander GOOD MATCH</p>
<p>ENTJs are strategic leaders, motivated to organize change. They are quick to see inefficiency and conceptualize new solutions and enjoy developing long-range plans to accomplish their vision. (truity.com)</p>
 
<h1>Learning Style Test</h1>
<p>What's Your Learning Style? The Results Colin's scores: Auditory: 25% Visual: 35% Tactile: 40%</p>
<p>You are a Tactile learner</p>
<p>You learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still. As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back. Here are some things that tactile learners like you can do to learn better.</p>
<p>Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving, or drawing. Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories. It's OK to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or studying. Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships between ideas. Trace words with your finger to learn spelling (finger spelling). Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long). It's OK to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning. Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch. Remember that you learn best by doing, not just by reading, seeing, or hearing. (educationplanner.org)</p>

<h1>Personality Test</h1>
<p>Kinaesthetic is your primary learning style.</p>
<p>Kinaesthetic style is learning by doing. You learn in this manner whenever you capture new information through the process of physical activity. It is often referred to as a hands-on learning experience. Consider how you learned to ride a bicycle. You learned by getting on a bike to experience and practice balancing, steering and pedalling. This experience ultimately taught you how to ride.</p>
<p>Visual is your secondary learning style.</p>
<p>Visual style is learning by seeing. You learn visually whenever you gain information from sight. This includes more than just the viewing of pictures and your surroundings. Visual learning also encompasses the written word. Visual learners benefit greatly from teaching that utilizes illustrations, charts, diagrams, videos, etc. They often feel a need to convert spoken instruction into visual form by taking notes.</p>
<p>Auditory is your least preferred learning style.</p>
<p>Auditory style is learning by hearing. This type of learning is helpful in the classroom environment. During a lecture, an auditory learner can easily comprehend, process and retain information. Auditory learning is not only the ability to listen to spoken word and interpret tone, but to do so with a high level of accuracy and efficiency. Learners with strong auditory ability can hear and comprehend without missing much. (personalitymax.com)</p>
<h1>What do these results mean to me</h1>
<p>What the results of these tests to mean to me is that I am able to know more about myself and how people may perceive me to be. It also gives me an insight of who I am and what I need to work on to improve parts of me, my attitude, how actions I take affect other people and how change is good at times. I feel that these results will not influence my behaviour in a team. I hope the way I am would be beneficial to a team. If I had the results of the other team members, I would take this information into account so that a team could be created for the task required. The importance of having someone who is a thinker rather than a feeler, depending on the size of the team, someone who is an extravert rather than an introvert, a perceiver rather than a judger. I feel that all of these need to be considered when forming a team, having a team full of ‘Supervisors’ would only be detrimental to the team.
