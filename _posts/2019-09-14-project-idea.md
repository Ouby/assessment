<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>My idea for the project is to have a system which would allow the way street lighting is turned on and off to be totally automated individually. This project I consider could be split into parts. Part 1 motorway lighting and part 2 street lighting. The concept is to automate street lighting so that when a car approaches a light pole it will automatically switch on, likewise when the car goes past the light pole, it will automatically turn off.</p>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>The motivation for this idea is to reduce running cost for the street lighting and to reduce lighting pollution.</p>
<p>Existing street lighting is controlled by an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) which works on light intensity (when dark switch on, when light switch off). Normally you would have one LDR controlling a bank of lights so as not to have the problem of some streetlight are switched on whilst others are off. I feel that this project could reverse that idea and have each streetlight independently switched from the other lights switching on and off when needed.</p>
<p>I consider that this project would have an advantage of capable be retro-fitted to existing streetlamps.</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Street lighting hasnâ€™t changed much over the years, they come on at night and go off in the morning. They were first controlled by a time switch which was set to turn the light on and off at set times, this changed to using an LDR which made them more reliable.</p>
<p>Most of us know when driving along a motorway at night, you can see the lights on for the next 2 or 3 kilometres ahead of you, but the worst thing is, if you are the only person on the motorway not only can you can still see for that distance but also the same amount of lights are on behind you. I feel that this project could change the way this happens by switching on for a distance of about 500 metres in front of a vehicle and off when the vehicle has gone past the street lamp by about 100 meters, for street lighting this could be reduced to about 50 meters Infront and 30 meters behind. The distances could be significantly reduced with autonomous cars but greatly increased for emergency vehicles.</p>
<p>Potentially the system could reduce the running cost of lighting to over half of the existing cost and if light poles were fitted with solar cells and batteries, the running cost could be reduced to near zero.</p>
<p>The existing running cost for a streetlight is $0.21195/KWh, (Ergon.com.au) with each motorway lamp being about 250 Watts, the running cost per lamp is about $232 per year, on a suburban street this is about $88.00 per year with a 95 Watt lamp. On a stretch of motorway there are about 22 streetlights per 1 kilometre of road and in suburban streets there are about 28 streetlamps per kilometre of road, (qld.gov. Requirements for road lighting) this equates to a cost of about $5104 and $2464 per year per kilometre of road.</p>
<h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
<p>The software required would need to be able to communicate with the vehicles satellite navigation system as well as the vehicles engine management system. I consider the software will need to be a proprietary software for both security and safety reasons. The hardware would have to be constructed in two formats, one as a chip to be installed within the vehicle at the manufacturing stage and the other as a standalone unit that could be retrofitted within any vehicle.</p>
<h1>Skills Required</h1>
<p>People required for this project would need to have skills in programming software for the project itself plus the programming requirements to allow for the integrating the system into a vehicle satellite system. There will also be a program requirement for the system to be a stand-alone unit. A program would have to be written to allow it to communicate with the street lighting and the vehicle itself. The hardware needed would have to be in two options, one for integration, and one as a standalone unit or add-on. I do not consider it would not be hard to find skilled people to complete this project as I feel most of the technology is already available.</p>
<h1>Outcome</h1>
<p>If the project is successful, I consider the outcome would be a considerable cost saving to local government with power bills and the significant reduction in lighting pollution with a benefit to some residents within a street who have a problem with street lighting shining into their house. I consider the cost saving over time should be of a great benefit the general public.</p>
